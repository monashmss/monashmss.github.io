          <p>Hey groovers!
          <br />Here is the very first news post for the Monash MSS website, and I get the privilege of writing that first awkward post. “Welcome!” “excited to be online!” “I have no idea what to talk about” and the like. So take a look around. We’ll be including an online membership service and a database for networking with other musicians in the future. We’ll also be posting upcoming events, so this is the place for checking out details. If you’d like to be notified of the stuff we do, but aren’t a member, you can sign up to our mailing list by clicking Sign Up, which is somewhat counterintuitive, I know.
          <br />I’m gonna leave it at that. Enjoy the rest of your semester! Take care of yourself above anything else. 
          <br />-Caterina</p>
