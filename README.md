###A place for the musicians of Monash...  
The Monash Music Students’ Society is a club established by students of the university’s music faculty, primarily aimed at enhancing cohesion amongst students, facilitating communication between staff and students, providing academic and study support, and holding social events both in and outside of the university. After a year of planning, MMSS was officially inaugurated in May 2015 and, in just a few short months, has over 150 members.
